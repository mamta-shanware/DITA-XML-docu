        <p class="p">To successfully perform the task of dividing numbers, you must understand what division
            is. The term “Division” represents a mathematical operation used to split a number into
            equal parts. Division is a process you perform using numbers. It lets you find out how
            many times one number is contained within another. In the App, you must use the divide
            (÷) button to perform the division operation. In this process, we take a larger number
            and break it down into smaller, equal groups by dividing it by another number.</p>
