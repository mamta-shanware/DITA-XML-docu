        <p class="p">To successfully perform the task of summing up of numbers, you must know what is
            addition. The term "Addition" represents a mathematical operation. Addition is a process
            that you perform using numbers. It lets you find the sum of two numbers. In the App, you
            must use the plus (+) button to perform the sum up or addition operation. In the sum up
            process, we take a number and increase it to a bigger number. We do this by combining
            one number with another to get a total.</p>
