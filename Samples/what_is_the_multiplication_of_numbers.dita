        <p>To successfully perform the task of multiplying numbers, you must know what is
            multiplication. The term "Multiplication" represents a mathematical operation.
            Multiplication is a process that you perform using numbers. It lets you find the product
            of two numbers. In the App, you must use the multiply (Ã—) button to perform the
            multiplication operation. In this process, we take a number and increase it to a larger
            value by combining it multiple times. We do this by multiplying one number by another to
            get the total product.</p>
